1)Officers of which rank had most complaints against them?

2)Analyzing whether officers who are charged with misconduct use weapons or beat up victims bare handed. 
This can be done using the TRR table using fields like number of shots fired or weapon found.

3)How many of the incidents were carried out by off duty officers?


4)Impact of inspecting officer’s race on the result of the investigation.
